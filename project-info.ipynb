    "- You are a junior data scientist on the Zillow data science team and recieve the following email in your inbox:\n",
    "    - We want to be able to predict the values of single unit properties that the tax district assesses using the property data from those with a `transaction` during the \"hot months\" \n",
    "        - **May-August, 2017.**\n",
    "- We also need some additional information outside of the model.\n",
    "    - Zach lost the email that told us where these properties were located. Ugh, Zach :-/. \n",
    "        - Because property taxes are assessed at the county level, we would like to know what **states and counties these are located in**.\n",
    "- We'd also like to know the **distribution of tax rates for each county**.\n",
    "    - a histogram would work with this\n",
    "        - 1 hist per county\n",
    "        - 1 clean layered histogram\n",
    "            - ONLY IF IT IS CLEAN ENOUGH\n",
    "    - The data should have the tax amounts and tax value of the home, so it shouldn't be too hard to calculate. \n",
    "    - Please include in your report to us the distribution of tax rates for each county so that we can see how much they vary within the properties in the county and the rates the bulk of the properties sit around.\n",
    "        - Note that this is separate from the model you will build, because if you use tax amount in your model, you would be using a future data point to predict a future data point, and that is cheating! \n",
    "            - In other words, for prediction purposes, we won't know tax amount until we know tax value."
